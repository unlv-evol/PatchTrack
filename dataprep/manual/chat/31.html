<code>MyStruct</code> and another goroutine reads from this pointer, you most likely need to use synchronization mechanisms such as a lock to avoid potential data races and ensure memory visibility between goroutines.</p><p>In Go, the memory model does not guarantee that changes made by one goroutine to shared variables (like your pointer <code>X</code>) are immediately visible to other goroutines without proper synchronization. This means the second goroutine might not see the updates to <code>X</code> in a timely manner, or worse, it might see a partially updated state if the write and read happen simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior.</p><p>Using a lock, such as <code>sync.Mutex</code>, ensures that only one goroutine can access the variable at a time, thus preventing data races. Here's how you might modify your example to use a <code>sync.Mutex</code> for safe access to <code>X</code>:</p><pre><div class="dark bg-gray-950 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-token-text-secondary bg-token-main-surface-secondary px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>go</span><span class="" data-state="closed"><button class="flex gap-1 items-center"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sm"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M12 4C10.8954 4 10 4.89543 10 6H14C14 4.89543 13.1046 4 12 4ZM8.53513 4C9.22675 2.8044 10.5194 2 12 2C13.4806 2 14.7733 2.8044 15.4649 4H17C18.6569 4 20 5.34315 20 7V19C20 20.6569 18.6569 22 17 22H7C5.34315 22 4 20.6569 4 19V7C4 5.34315 5.34315 4 7 4H8.53513ZM8 6H7C6.44772 6 6 6.44772 6 7V19C6 19.5523 6.44772 20 7 20H17C17.5523 20 18 19.5523 18 19V7C18 6.44772 17.5523 6 17 6H16C16 7.10457 15.1046 8 14 8H10C8.89543 8 8 7.10457 8 6Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>Copy code</button></span></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> (

Depending on your specific use case, other concurrency mechanisms provided by Go, such as channels or atomic operations from the <code>sync/atomic</code> package, might be more appropriate and could offer better performance or simplicity. Atomic operations, for example, can be used for simple read-modify-write operations on primitive types without the overhead of locking, but they require careful use to ensure

However, in practice, because of the way modern computers work, <code>tempX</code> is highly unlikely to point to a completely arbitrary or invalid memory location due to the atomic nature of pointer assignments on most platforms.

It doesn't necessarily mean that the program will do something entirely nonsensical like assigning a random memory address to <code>tempX</code>, but it does mean the program's correctness cannot be assured, and it might behave differently across runs, compiler versions, or hardware.</p><p>The key takeaway is that while you might not get a "completely random value" in the sense of pointing to arbitrary memory, accessing shared memory without proper synchronization in concurrent programming can lead to subtle, hard-to-debug errors. It's always best practice to use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, channels, or atomic operations to ensure memory visibility and avoid data races, ensuring that your program behaves correctly and predictably.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full text-token-text-primary" data-testid="conversation-turn-6" style="--avatar-color: #19c37d;"><div class="px-4 py-2 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 m-auto"><div class="flex flex-1 text-base mx-auto gap-3 md:max-w-3xl lg:max-w-[40rem] xl:max-w-[48rem] group"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div><div class="pt-0.5"><div class="gizmo-shadow-stroke flex h-6 w-6 items-center justify-center overflow-hidden rounded-full"><div class="relative p-1 rounded-sm h-9 w-9 text-white flex items-center justify-center" style="background-color: rgb(121, 137, 255); width: 24px; height: 24px;"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M20 21v-2a4 4 0 0 0-4-4H8a4 4 0 0 0-4 4v2"></path><circle cx="12" cy="7" r="4"></circle></svg></div></div></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-full flex-col"><div class="font-semibold select-none">Anonymous</div><div class="flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full"><div data-message-author-role="user" data-message-id="aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf" class="min-h-[20px] text-message flex flex-col items-start gap-3 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 overflow-x-auto"><div class="">What does this doc say about copying a pointer?

Introduction
The Go memory model specifies the conditions under which reads of a variable in one goroutine can be guaranteed to observe values produced by writes to the same variable in a different goroutine.

Advice
Programs that modify data being simultaneously accessed by multiple goroutines must serialize such access.

To serialize access, protect the data with channel operations or other synchronization primitives such as those in the sync and sync/atomic packages.

If you must read the rest of this document to understand the behavior of your program, you are being too clever.

Don't be clever.

Informal Overview
Go approaches its memory model in much the same way as the rest of the language, aiming to keep the semantics simple, understandable, and useful. This section gives a general overview of the approach and should suffice for most programmers. The memory model is specified more formally in the next section.

A data race is defined as a write to a memory location happening concurrently with another read or write to that same location, unless all the accesses involved are atomic data accesses as provided by the sync/atomic package. As noted already, programmers are strongly encouraged to use appropriate synchronization to avoid data races. In the absence of data races, Go programs behave as if all the goroutines were multiplexed onto a single processor. This property is sometimes referred to as DRF-SC: data-race-free programs execute in a sequentially consistent manner.

While programmers should write Go programs without data races, there are limitations to what a Go implementation can do in response to a data race. An implementation may always react to a data race by reporting the race and terminating the program. Otherwise, each read of a single-word-sized or sub-word-sized memory location must observe a value actually written to that location (perhaps by a concurrent executing goroutine) and not yet overwritten. These implementation constraints make Go more like Java or JavaScript, in that most races have a limited number of outcomes, and less like C and C++, where the meaning of any program with a race is entirely undefined, and the compiler may do anything at all. Go's approach aims to make errant programs more reliable and easier to debug, while still insisting that races are errors and that tools can diagnose and report them.

Memory Model
The following formal definition of Go's memory model closely follows the approach presented by Hans-J. Boehm and Sarita V. Adve in “Foundations of the C++ Concurrency Memory Model”, published in PLDI 2008. The definition of data-race-free programs and the guarantee of sequential consistency for race-free programs are equivalent to the ones in that work.

The memory model describes the requirements on program executions, which are made up of goroutine executions, which in turn are made up of memory operations.

A memory operation is modeled by four details:

its kind, indicating whether it is an ordinary data read, an ordinary data write, or a synchronizing operation such as an atomic data access, a mutex operation, or a channel operation,
its location in the program,
the memory location or variable being accessed, and
the values read or written by the operation.
Some memory operations are read-like, including read, atomic read, mutex lock, and channel receive. Other memory operations are write-like, including write, atomic write, mutex unlock, channel send, and channel close. Some, such as atomic compare-and-swap, are both read-like and write-like.

A goroutine execution is modeled as a set of memory operations executed by a single goroutine.

Requirement 1: The memory operations in each goroutine must correspond to a correct sequential execution of that goroutine, given the values read from and written to memory. That execution must be consistent with the sequenced before relation, defined as the partial order requirements set out by the Go language specification for Go's control flow constructs as well as the order of evaluation for expressions.

A Go program execution is modeled as a set of goroutine executions, together with a mapping W that specifies the write-like operation that each read-like operation reads from. (Multiple executions of the same program can have different program executions.)

Requirement 2: For a given program execution, the mapping W, when limited to synchronizing operations, must be explainable by some implicit total order of the synchronizing operations that is consistent with sequencing and the values read and written by those operations.

The synchronized before relation is a partial order on synchronizing memory operations, derived from W. If a synchronizing read-like memory operation r observes a synchronizing write-like memory operation w (that is, if W(r) = w), then w is synchronized before r. Informally, the synchronized before relation is a subset of the implied total order mentioned in the previous paragraph, limited to the information that W directly observes.

The happens before relation is defined as the transitive closure of the union of the sequenced before and synchronized before relations.

Requirement 3: For an ordinary (non-synchronizing) data read r on a memory location x, W(r) must be a write w that is visible to r, where visible means that both of the following hold:

w happens before r.
w does not happen before any other write w' (to x) that happens before r.
A read-write data race on memory location x consists of a read-like memory operation r on x and a write-like memory operation w on x, at least one of which is non-synchronizing, which are unordered by happens before (that is, neither r happens before w nor w happens before r).

A write-write data race on memory location x consists of two write-like memory operations w and w' on x, at least one of which is non-synchronizing, which are unordered by happens before.

Note that if there are no read-write or write-write data races on memory location x, then any read r on x has only one possible W(r): the single w that immediately precedes it in the happens before order.

More generally, it can be shown that any Go program that is data-race-free, meaning it has no program executions with read-write or write-write data races, can only have outcomes explained by some sequentially consistent interleaving of the goroutine executions. (The proof is the same as Section 7 of Boehm and Adve's paper cited above.) This property is called DRF-SC.

The intent of the formal definition is to match the DRF-SC guarantee provided to race-free programs by other languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Swift.

Certain Go language operations such as goroutine creation and memory allocation act as synchronization operations. The effect of these operations on the synchronized-before partial order is documented in the “Synchronization” section below. Individual packages are responsible for providing similar documentation for their own operations.

Implementation Restrictions for Programs Containing Data Races
The preceding section gave a formal definition of data-race-free program execution. This section informally describes the semantics that implementations must provide for programs that do contain races.

First, any implementation can, upon detecting a data race, report the race and halt execution of the program. Implementations using ThreadSanitizer (accessed with “go build -race”) do exactly this.

Otherwise, a read r of a memory location x that is not larger than a machine word must observe some write w such that r does not happen before w and there is no write w' such that w happens before w' and w' happens before r. That is, each read must observe a value written by a preceding or concurrent write.

Additionally, observation of acausal and “out of thin air” writes is disallowed.

Reads of memory locations larger than a single machine word are encouraged but not required to meet the same semantics as word-sized memory locations, observing a single allowed write w. For performance reasons, implementations may instead treat larger operations as a set of individual machine-word-sized operations in an unspecified order. This means that races on multiword data structures can lead to inconsistent values not corresponding to a single write. When the values depend on the consistency of internal (pointer, length) or (pointer, type) pairs, as can be the case for interface values, maps, slices, and strings in most Go implementations, such races can in turn lead to arbitrary memory corruption.

Examples of incorrect synchronization are given in the “Incorrect synchronization” section below.

Examples of the limitations on implementations are given in the “Incorrect compilation” section below.

Synchronization
Initialization
Program initialization runs in a single goroutine, but that goroutine may create other goroutines, which run concurrently.

If a package p imports package q, the completion of q's init functions happens before the start of any of p's.

The completion of all init functions is synchronized before the start of the function main.main.

Goroutine creation
The go statement that starts a new goroutine is synchronized before the start of the goroutine's execution.

For example, in this program:

var a string

func f() {
	print(a)
}

func hello() {
	a = "hello, world"
	go f()
}
calling hello will print "hello, world" at some point in the future (perhaps after hello has returned).

Goroutine destruction
The exit of a goroutine is not guaranteed to be synchronized before any event in the program. For example, in this program:

var a string

func hello() {
	go func() { a = "hello" }()
	print(a)
}
the assignment to a is not followed by any synchronization event, so it is not guaranteed to be observed by any other goroutine. In fact, an aggressive compiler might delete the entire go statement.

If the effects of a goroutine must be observed by another goroutine, use a synchronization mechanism such as a lock or channel communication to establish a relative ordering.

Channel communication
Channel communication is the main method of synchronization between goroutines. Each send on a particular channel is matched to a corresponding receive from that channel, usually in a different goroutine.

A send on a channel is synchronized before the completion of the corresponding receive from that channel.

This program:

var c = make(chan int, 10)
var a string

func f() {
	a = "hello, world"
	c &lt;- 0
}

func main() {
	go f()
	&lt;-c
	print(a)
}
is guaranteed to print "hello, world". The write to a is sequenced before the send on c, which is synchronized before the corresponding receive on c completes, which is sequenced before the print.

The closing of a channel is synchronized before a receive that returns a zero value because the channel is closed.

In the previous example, replacing c &lt;- 0 with close(c) yields a program with the same guaranteed behavior.

A receive from an unbuffered channel is synchronized before the completion of the corresponding send on that channel.

This program (as above, but with the send and receive statements swapped and using an unbuffered channel):

var c = make(chan int)
var a string

func f() {
	a = "hello, world"
	&lt;-c
}

func main() {
	go f()
	c &lt;- 0
	print(a)
}
is also guaranteed to print "hello, world". The write to a is sequenced before the receive on c, which is synchronized before the corresponding send on c completes, which is sequenced before the print.

If the channel were buffered (e.g., c = make(chan int, 1)) then the program would not be guaranteed to print "hello, world". (It might print the empty string, crash, or do something else.)

The kth receive on a channel with capacity C is synchronized before the completion of the k+Cth send from that channel completes.

This rule generalizes the previous rule to buffered channels. It allows a counting semaphore to be modeled by a buffered channel: the number of items in the channel corresponds to the number of active uses, the capacity of the channel corresponds to the maximum number of simultaneous uses, sending an item acquires the semaphore, and receiving an item releases the semaphore. This is a common idiom for limiting concurrency.

This program starts a goroutine for every entry in the work list, but the goroutines coordinate using the limit channel to ensure that at most three are running work functions at a time.

var limit = make(chan int, 3)

func main() {
	for _, w := range work {
		go func(w func()) {
			limit &lt;- 1
			w()
			&lt;-limit
		}(w)
	}
	select{}
}
Locks
The sync package implements two lock data types, sync.Mutex and sync.RWMutex.

For any sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex variable l and n &lt; m, call n of l.Unlock() is synchronized before call m of l.Lock() returns.

This program:

var l sync.Mutex
var a string

func f() {
	a = "hello, world"
	l.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	l.Lock()
	go f()
	l.Lock()
	print(a)
}
is guaranteed to print "hello, world". The first call to l.Unlock() (in f) is synchronized before the second call to l.Lock() (in main) returns, which is sequenced before the print.

For any call to l.RLock on a sync.RWMutex variable l, there is an n such that the nth call to l.Unlock is synchronized before the return from l.RLock, and the matching call to l.RUnlock is synchronized before the return from call n+1 to l.Lock.

A successful call to l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) is equivalent to a call to l.Lock (or l.RLock). An unsuccessful call has no synchronizing effect at all. As far as the memory model is concerned, l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) may be considered to be able to return false even when the mutex l is unlocked.

Once
The sync package provides a safe mechanism for initialization in the presence of multiple goroutines through the use of the Once type. Multiple threads can execute once.Do(f) for a particular f, but only one will run f(), and the other calls block until f() has returned.

The completion of a single call of f() from once.Do(f) is synchronized before the return of any call of once.Do(f).

In this program:

var a string
var once sync.Once

func setup() {
	a = "hello, world"
}

func doprint() {
	once.Do(setup)
	print(a)
}

func twoprint() {
	go doprint()
	go doprint()
}
calling twoprint will call setup exactly once. The setup function will complete before either call of print. The result will be that "hello, world" will be printed twice.

Atomic Values
The APIs in the sync/atomic package are collectively “atomic operations” that can be used to synchronize the execution of different goroutines. If the effect of an atomic operation A is observed by atomic operation B, then A is synchronized before B. All the atomic operations executed in a program behave as though executed in some sequentially consistent order.

The preceding definition has the same semantics as C++’s sequentially consistent atomics and Java’s volatile variables.

Finalizers
The runtime package provides a SetFinalizer function that adds a finalizer to be called when a particular object is no longer reachable by the program. A call to SetFinalizer(x, f) is synchronized before the finalization call f(x).

Additional Mechanisms
The sync package provides additional synchronization abstractions, including condition variables, lock-free maps, allocation pools, and wait groups. The documentation for each of these specifies the guarantees it makes concerning synchronization.

Other packages that provide synchronization abstractions should document the guarantees they make too.

Incorrect synchronization
Programs with races are incorrect and can exhibit non-sequentially consistent executions. In particular, note that a read r may observe the value written by any write w that executes concurrently with r. Even if this occurs, it does not imply that reads happening after r will observe writes that happened before w.

In this program:

var a, b int

func f() {
	a = 1
	b = 2
}

func g() {
	print(b)
	print(a)
}

func main() {
	go f()
	g()
}
it can happen that g prints 2 and then 0.

This fact invalidates a few common idioms.

Double-checked locking is an attempt to avoid the overhead of synchronization. For example, the twoprint program might be incorrectly written as:

var a string
var done bool

func setup() {
	a = "hello, world"
	done = true
}

func doprint() {
	if !done {
		once.Do(setup)
	}
	print(a)
}

func twoprint() {
	go doprint()
	go doprint()
}
but there is no guarantee that, in doprint, observing the write to done implies observing the write to a. This version can (incorrectly) print an empty string instead of "hello, world".

Another incorrect idiom is busy waiting for a value, as in:

var a string
var done bool

func setup() {
	a = "hello, world"
	done = true
}

func main() {
	go setup()
	for !done {
	}
	print(a)
}
As before, there is no guarantee that, in main, observing the write to done implies observing the write to a, so this program could print an empty string too. Worse, there is no guarantee that the write to done will ever be observed by main, since there are no synchronization events between the two threads. The loop in main is not guaranteed to finish.

There are subtler variants on this theme, such as this program.

type T struct {
	msg string
}

var g *T

func setup() {
	t := new(T)
	t.msg = "hello, world"
	g = t
}

func main() {
	go setup()
	for g == nil {
	}
	print(g.msg)
}
Even if main observes g != nil and exits its loop, there is no guarantee that it will observe the initialized value for g.msg.

In all these examples, the solution is the same: use explicit synchronization.

Incorrect compilation
The Go memory model restricts compiler optimizations as much as it does Go programs. Some compiler optimizations that would be valid in single-threaded programs are not valid in all Go programs. In particular, a compiler must not introduce writes that do not exist in the original program, it must not allow a single read to observe multiple values, and it must not allow a single write to write multiple values.

All the following examples assume that `*p` and `*q` refer to memory locations accessible to multiple goroutines.

Not introducing data races into race-free programs means not moving writes out of conditional statements in which they appear. For example, a compiler must not invert the conditional in this program:

*p = 1
if cond {
	*p = 2
}
That is, the compiler must not rewrite the program into this one:

*p = 2
if !cond {
	*p = 1
}
If cond is false and another goroutine is reading *p, then in the original program, the other goroutine can only observe any prior value of *p and 1. In the rewritten program, the other goroutine can observe 2, which was previously impossible.

Not introducing data races also means not assuming that loops terminate. For example, a compiler must in general not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the loop in this program:

n := 0
for e := list; e != nil; e = e.next {
	n++
}
i := *p
*q = 1
If list pointed to a cyclic list, then the original program would never access *p or *q, but the rewritten program would. (Moving `*p` ahead would be safe if the compiler can prove `*p` will not panic; moving `*q` ahead would also require the compiler proving that no other goroutine can access `*q`.)

Not introducing data races also means not assuming that called functions always return or are free of synchronization operations. For example, a compiler must not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the function call in this program (at least not without direct knowledge of the precise behavior of f):

f()
i := *p
*q = 1
If the call never returned, then once again the original program would never access *p or *q, but the rewritten program would. And if the call contained synchronizing operations, then the original program could establish happens before edges preceding the accesses to *p and *q, but the rewritten program would not.

Not allowing a single read to observe multiple values means not reloading local variables from shared memory. For example, a compiler must not discard i and reload it a second time from *p in this program:

i := *p
if i &lt; 0 || i &gt;= len(funcs) {
	panic("invalid function index")
}
... complex code ...
// compiler must NOT reload i = *p here
funcs[i]()
If the complex code needs many registers, a compiler for single-threaded programs could discard i without saving a copy and then reload i = *p just before funcs[i](). A Go compiler must not, because the value of *p may have changed. (Instead, the compiler could spill i to the stack.)

Not allowing a single write to write multiple values also means not using the memory where a local variable will be written as temporary storage before the write. For example, a compiler must not use *p as temporary storage in this program:

*p = i + *p/2
That is, it must not rewrite the program into this one:

*p /= 2
*p += i
If i and *p start equal to 2, the original code does *p = 3, so a racing thread can read only 2 or 3 from *p. The rewritten code does *p = 1 and then *p = 3, allowing a racing thread to read 1 as well.

Note that all these optimizations are permitted in C/C++ compilers: a Go compiler sharing a back end with a C/C++ compiler must take care to disable optimizations that are invalid for Go.

Note that the prohibition on introducing data races does not apply if the compiler can prove that the races do not affect correct execution on the target platform. For example, on essentially all CPUs, it is valid to rewrite

n := 0
for i := 0; i &lt; m; i++ {
	n += *shared
}
into:
n := 0
local := *shared
for i := 0; i &lt; m; i++ {
	n += local
}
provided it can be proved that *shared will not fault on access, because the potential added read will not affect any existing concurrent reads or writes. On the other hand, the rewrite would not be valid in a source-to-source translator.

Conclusion
Go programmers writing data-race-free programs can rely on sequentially consistent execution of those programs, just as in essentially all other modern programming languages.

When it comes to programs with races, both programmers and compilers should remember the advice: don't be clever.

Therefore, the safe approach for concurrent programming in Go is to use channels, mutexes, or atomic operations from the `sync` and `sync/atomic` packages to serialize access to shared data, including when working with pointers shared across goroutines."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"is_complete":true,"model_slug":"gpt-4","parent_id":"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf","timestamp_":"absolute","shared_conversation_id":"f8aade6f-7822-484a-9057-f656f7429669"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf","children":[]},"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf":{"id":"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf","message":{"id":"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf","author":{"role":"user","metadata":{}},"create_time":1707027834.055919,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What does this doc say about copying a pointer?\n\nGo\nSkip to Main Content\nWhy Go\narrow_drop_down\nLearn\nDocs\narrow_drop_down\nPackages\nCommunity\narrow_drop_down\nGo.\nWhy Gonavigate_next\nnavigate_beforeWhy Go\nCase Studies\nUse Cases\nSecurity\nLearn\nDocsnavigate_next\nnavigate_beforeDocs\nEffective Go\nGo User Manual\nStandard library\nRelease Notes\nPackages\nCommunitynavigate_next\nnavigate_beforeCommunity\nRecorded Talks\nMeetups open_in_new\nConferences open_in_new\nGo blog\nGo project\nGet connected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Go Memory Model\nVersion of June 6, 2022\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nAdvice\nInformal Overview\nMemory Model\nImplementation Restrictions for Programs Containing Data Races\nSynchronization\nInitialization\nGoroutine creation\nGoroutine destruction\nChannel communication\nLocks\nOnce\nAtomic Values\nFinalizers\nAdditional Mechanisms\nIncorrect synchronization\nIncorrect compilation\nConclusion\nIntroduction\nThe Go memory model specifies the conditions under which reads of a variable in one goroutine can be guaranteed to observe values produced by writes to the same variable in a different goroutine.\n\nAdvice\nPrograms that modify data being simultaneously accessed by multiple goroutines must serialize such access.\n\nTo serialize access, protect the data with channel operations or other synchronization primitives such as those in the sync and sync/atomic packages.\n\nIf you must read the rest of this document to understand the behavior of your program, you are being too clever.\n\nDon't be clever.\n\nInformal Overview\nGo approaches its memory model in much the same way as the rest of the language, aiming to keep the semantics simple, understandable, and useful. This section gives a general overview of the approach and should suffice for most programmers. The memory model is specified more formally in the next section.\n\nA data race is defined as a write to a memory location happening concurrently with another read or write to that same location, unless all the accesses involved are atomic data accesses as provided by the sync/atomic package. As noted already, programmers are strongly encouraged to use appropriate synchronization to avoid data races. In the absence of data races, Go programs behave as if all the goroutines were multiplexed onto a single processor. This property is sometimes referred to as DRF-SC: data-race-free programs execute in a sequentially consistent manner.\n\nWhile programmers should write Go programs without data races, there are limitations to what a Go implementation can do in response to a data race. An implementation may always react to a data race by reporting the race and terminating the program. Otherwise, each read of a single-word-sized or sub-word-sized memory location must observe a value actually written to that location (perhaps by a concurrent executing goroutine) and not yet overwritten. These implementation constraints make Go more like Java or JavaScript, in that most races have a limited number of outcomes, and less like C and C++, where the meaning of any program with a race is entirely undefined, and the compiler may do anything at all. Go's approach aims to make errant programs more reliable and easier to debug, while still insisting that races are errors and that tools can diagnose and report them.\n\nMemory Model\nThe following formal definition of Go's memory model closely follows the approach presented by Hans-J. Boehm and Sarita V. Adve in “Foundations of the C++ Concurrency Memory Model”, published in PLDI 2008. The definition of data-race-free programs and the guarantee of sequential consistency for race-free programs are equivalent to the ones in that work.\n\nThe memory model describes the requirements on program executions, which are made up of goroutine executions, which in turn are made up of memory operations.\n\nA memory operation is modeled by four details:\n\nits kind, indicating whether it is an ordinary data read, an ordinary data write, or a synchronizing operation such as an atomic data access, a mutex operation, or a channel operation,\nits location in the program,\nthe memory location or variable being accessed, and\nthe values read or written by the operation.\nSome memory operations are read-like, including read, atomic read, mutex lock, and channel receive. Other memory operations are write-like, including write, atomic write, mutex unlock, channel send, and channel close. Some, such as atomic compare-and-swap, are both read-like and write-like.\n\nA goroutine execution is modeled as a set of memory operations executed by a single goroutine.\n\nRequirement 1: The memory operations in each goroutine must correspond to a correct sequential execution of that goroutine, given the values read from and written to memory. That execution must be consistent with the sequenced before relation, defined as the partial order requirements set out by the Go language specification for Go's control flow constructs as well as the order of evaluation for expressions.\n\nA Go program execution is modeled as a set of goroutine executions, together with a mapping W that specifies the write-like operation that each read-like operation reads from. (Multiple executions of the same program can have different program executions.)\n\nRequirement 2: For a given program execution, the mapping W, when limited to synchronizing operations, must be explainable by some implicit total order of the synchronizing operations that is consistent with sequencing and the values read and written by those operations.\n\nThe synchronized before relation is a partial order on synchronizing memory operations, derived from W. If a synchronizing read-like memory operation r observes a synchronizing write-like memory operation w (that is, if W(r) = w), then w is synchronized before r. Informally, the synchronized before relation is a subset of the implied total order mentioned in the previous paragraph, limited to the information that W directly observes.\n\nThe happens before relation is defined as the transitive closure of the union of the sequenced before and synchronized before relations.\n\nRequirement 3: For an ordinary (non-synchronizing) data read r on a memory location x, W(r) must be a write w that is visible to r, where visible means that both of the following hold:\n\nw happens before r.\nw does not happen before any other write w' (to x) that happens before r.\nA read-write data race on memory location x consists of a read-like memory operation r on x and a write-like memory operation w on x, at least one of which is non-synchronizing, which are unordered by happens before (that is, neither r happens before w nor w happens before r).\n\nA write-write data race on memory location x consists of two write-like memory operations w and w' on x, at least one of which is non-synchronizing, which are unordered by happens before.\n\nNote that if there are no read-write or write-write data races on memory location x, then any read r on x has only one possible W(r): the single w that immediately precedes it in the happens before order.\n\nMore generally, it can be shown that any Go program that is data-race-free, meaning it has no program executions with read-write or write-write data races, can only have outcomes explained by some sequentially consistent interleaving of the goroutine executions. (The proof is the same as Section 7 of Boehm and Adve's paper cited above.) This property is called DRF-SC.\n\nThe intent of the formal definition is to match the DRF-SC guarantee provided to race-free programs by other languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Swift.\n\nCertain Go language operations such as goroutine creation and memory allocation act as synchronization operations. The effect of these operations on the synchronized-before partial order is documented in the “Synchronization” section below. Individual packages are responsible for providing similar documentation for their own operations.\n\nImplementation Restrictions for Programs Containing Data Races\nThe preceding section gave a formal definition of data-race-free program execution. This section informally describes the semantics that implementations must provide for programs that do contain races.\n\nFirst, any implementation can, upon detecting a data race, report the race and halt execution of the program. Implementations using ThreadSanitizer (accessed with “go build -race”) do exactly this.\n\nOtherwise, a read r of a memory location x that is not larger than a machine word must observe some write w such that r does not happen before w and there is no write w' such that w happens before w' and w' happens before r. That is, each read must observe a value written by a preceding or concurrent write.\n\nAdditionally, observation of acausal and “out of thin air” writes is disallowed.\n\nReads of memory locations larger than a single machine word are encouraged but not required to meet the same semantics as word-sized memory locations, observing a single allowed write w. For performance reasons, implementations may instead treat larger operations as a set of individual machine-word-sized operations in an unspecified order. This means that races on multiword data structures can lead to inconsistent values not corresponding to a single write. When the values depend on the consistency of internal (pointer, length) or (pointer, type) pairs, as can be the case for interface values, maps, slices, and strings in most Go implementations, such races can in turn lead to arbitrary memory corruption.\n\nExamples of incorrect synchronization are given in the “Incorrect synchronization” section below.\n\nExamples of the limitations on implementations are given in the “Incorrect compilation” section below.\n\nSynchronization\nInitialization\nProgram initialization runs in a single goroutine, but that goroutine may create other goroutines, which run concurrently.\n\nIf a package p imports package q, the completion of q's init functions happens before the start of any of p's.\n\nThe completion of all init functions is synchronized before the start of the function main.main.\n\nGoroutine creation\nThe go statement that starts a new goroutine is synchronized before the start of the goroutine's execution.\n\nFor example, in this program:\n\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc hello() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tgo f()\n}\ncalling hello will print \"hello, world\" at some point in the future (perhaps after hello has returned).\n\nGoroutine destruction\nThe exit of a goroutine is not guaranteed to be synchronized before any event in the program. For example, in this program:\n\nvar a string\n\nfunc hello() {\n\tgo func() { a = \"hello\" }()\n\tprint(a)\n}\nthe assignment to a is not followed by any synchronization event, so it is not guaranteed to be observed by any other goroutine. In fact, an aggressive compiler might delete the entire go statement.\n\nIf the effects of a goroutine must be observed by another goroutine, use a synchronization mechanism such as a lock or channel communication to establish a relative ordering.\n\nChannel communication\nChannel communication is the main method of synchronization between goroutines. Each send on a particular channel is matched to a corresponding receive from that channel, usually in a different goroutine.\n\nA send on a channel is synchronized before the completion of the corresponding receive from that channel.\n\nThis program:\n\nvar c = make(chan int, 10)\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tc \u003c- 0\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo f()\n\t\u003c-c\n\tprint(a)\n}\nis guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". The write to a is sequenced before the send on c, which is synchronized before the corresponding receive on c completes, which is sequenced before the print.\n\nThe closing of a channel is synchronized before a receive that returns a zero value because the channel is closed.\n\nIn the previous example, replacing c \u003c- 0 with close(c) yields a program with the same guaranteed behavior.\n\nA receive from an unbuffered channel is synchronized before the completion of the corresponding send on that channel.\n\nThis program (as above, but with the send and receive statements swapped and using an unbuffered channel):\n\nvar c = make(chan int)\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\t\u003c-c\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo f()\n\tc \u003c- 0\n\tprint(a)\n}\nis also guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". The write to a is sequenced before the receive on c, which is synchronized before the corresponding send on c completes, which is sequenced before the print.\n\nIf the channel were buffered (e.g., c = make(chan int, 1)) then the program would not be guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". (It might print the empty string, crash, or do something else.)\n\nThe kth receive on a channel with capacity C is synchronized before the completion of the k+Cth send from that channel completes.\n\nThis rule generalizes the previous rule to buffered channels. It allows a counting semaphore to be modeled by a buffered channel: the number of items in the channel corresponds to the number of active uses, the capacity of the channel corresponds to the maximum number of simultaneous uses, sending an item acquires the semaphore, and receiving an item releases the semaphore. This is a common idiom for limiting concurrency.\n\nThis program starts a goroutine for every entry in the work list, but the goroutines coordinate using the limit channel to ensure that at most three are running work functions at a time.\n\nvar limit = make(chan int, 3)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfor _, w := range work {\n\t\tgo func(w func()) {\n\t\t\tlimit \u003c- 1\n\t\t\tw()\n\t\t\t\u003c-limit\n\t\t}(w)\n\t}\n\tselect{}\n}\nLocks\nThe sync package implements two lock data types, sync.Mutex and sync.RWMutex.\n\nFor any sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex variable l and n \u003c m, call n of l.Unlock() is synchronized before call m of l.Lock() returns.\n\nThis program:\n\nvar l sync.Mutex\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tl.Unlock()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tl.Lock()\n\tgo f()\n\tl.Lock()\n\tprint(a)\n}\nis guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". The first call to l.Unlock() (in f) is synchronized before the second call to l.Lock() (in main) returns, which is sequenced before the print.\n\nFor any call to l.RLock on a sync.RWMutex variable l, there is an n such that the nth call to l.Unlock is synchronized before the return from l.RLock, and the matching call to l.RUnlock is synchronized before the return from call n+1 to l.Lock.\n\nA successful call to l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) is equivalent to a call to l.Lock (or l.RLock). An unsuccessful call has no synchronizing effect at all. As far as the memory model is concerned, l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) may be considered to be able to return false even when the mutex l is unlocked.\n\nOnce\nThe sync package provides a safe mechanism for initialization in the presence of multiple goroutines through the use of the Once type. Multiple threads can execute once.Do(f) for a particular f, but only one will run f(), and the other calls block until f() has returned.\n\nThe completion of a single call of f() from once.Do(f) is synchronized before the return of any call of once.Do(f).\n\nIn this program:\n\nvar a string\nvar once sync.Once\n\nfunc setup() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n}\n\nfunc doprint() {\n\tonce.Do(setup)\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc twoprint() {\n\tgo doprint()\n\tgo doprint()\n}\ncalling twoprint will call setup exactly once. The setup function will complete before either call of print. The result will be that \"hello, world\" will be printed twice.\n\nAtomic Values\nThe APIs in the sync/atomic package are collectively “atomic operations” that can be used to synchronize the execution of different goroutines. If the effect of an atomic operation A is observed by atomic operation B, then A is synchronized before B. All the atomic operations executed in a program behave as though executed in some sequentially consistent order.\n\nThe preceding definition has the same semantics as C++’s sequentially consistent atomics and Java’s volatile variables.\n\nFinalizers\nThe runtime package provides a SetFinalizer function that adds a finalizer to be called when a particular object is no longer reachable by the program. A call to SetFinalizer(x, f) is synchronized before the finalization call f(x).\n\nAdditional Mechanisms\nThe sync package provides additional synchronization abstractions, including condition variables, lock-free maps, allocation pools, and wait groups. The documentation for each of these specifies the guarantees it makes concerning synchronization.\n\nOther packages that provide synchronization abstractions should document the guarantees they make too.\n\nIncorrect synchronization\nPrograms with races are incorrect and can exhibit non-sequentially consistent executions. In particular, note that a read r may observe the value written by any write w that executes concurrently with r. Even if this occurs, it does not imply that reads happening after r will observe writes that happened before w.\n\nIn this program:\n\nvar a, b int\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = 1\n\tb = 2\n}\n\nfunc g() {\n\tprint(b)\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo f()\n\tg()\n}\nit can happen that g prints 2 and then 0.\n\nThis fact invalidates a few common idioms.\n\nDouble-checked locking is an attempt to avoid the overhead of synchronization. For example, the twoprint program might be incorrectly written as:\n\nvar a string\nvar done bool\n\nfunc setup() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tdone = true\n}\n\nfunc doprint() {\n\tif !done {\n\t\tonce.Do(setup)\n\t}\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc twoprint() {\n\tgo doprint()\n\tgo doprint()\n}\nbut there is no guarantee that, in doprint, observing the write to done implies observing the write to a. This version can (incorrectly) print an empty string instead of \"hello, world\".\n\nAnother incorrect idiom is busy waiting for a value, as in:\n\nvar a string\nvar done bool\n\nfunc setup() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tdone = true\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo setup()\n\tfor !done {\n\t}\n\tprint(a)\n}\nAs before, there is no guarantee that, in main, observing the write to done implies observing the write to a, so this program could print an empty string too. Worse, there is no guarantee that the write to done will ever be observed by main, since there are no synchronization events between the two threads. The loop in main is not guaranteed to finish.\n\nThere are subtler variants on this theme, such as this program.\n\ntype T struct {\n\tmsg string\n}\n\nvar g *T\n\nfunc setup() {\n\tt := new(T)\n\tt.msg = \"hello, world\"\n\tg = t\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo setup()\n\tfor g == nil {\n\t}\n\tprint(g.msg)\n}\nEven if main observes g != nil and exits its loop, there is no guarantee that it will observe the initialized value for g.msg.\n\nIn all these examples, the solution is the same: use explicit synchronization.\n\nIncorrect compilation\nThe Go memory model restricts compiler optimizations as much as it does Go programs. Some compiler optimizations that would be valid in single-threaded programs are not valid in all Go programs. In particular, a compiler must not introduce writes that do not exist in the original program, it must not allow a single read to observe multiple values, and it must not allow a single write to write multiple values.\n\nAll the following examples assume that `*p` and `*q` refer to memory locations accessible to multiple goroutines.\n\nNot introducing data races into race-free programs means not moving writes out of conditional statements in which they appear. For example, a compiler must not invert the conditional in this program:\n\n*p = 1\nif cond {\n\t*p = 2\n}\nThat is, the compiler must not rewrite the program into this one:\n\n*p = 2\nif !cond {\n\t*p = 1\n}\nIf cond is false and another goroutine is reading *p, then in the original program, the other goroutine can only observe any prior value of *p and 1. In the rewritten program, the other goroutine can observe 2, which was previously impossible.\n\nNot introducing data races also means not assuming that loops terminate. For example, a compiler must in general not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the loop in this program:\n\nn := 0\nfor e := list; e != nil; e = e.next {\n\tn++\n}\ni := *p\n*q = 1\nIf list pointed to a cyclic list, then the original program would never access *p or *q, but the rewritten program would. (Moving `*p` ahead would be safe if the compiler can prove `*p` will not panic; moving `*q` ahead would also require the compiler proving that no other goroutine can access `*q`.)\n\nNot introducing data races also means not assuming that called functions always return or are free of synchronization operations. For example, a compiler must not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the function call in this program (at least not without direct knowledge of the precise behavior of f):\n\nf()\ni := *p\n*q = 1\nIf the call never returned, then once again the original program would never access *p or *q, but the rewritten program would. And if the call contained synchronizing operations, then the original program could establish happens before edges preceding the accesses to *p and *q, but the rewritten program would not.\n\nNot allowing a single read to observe multiple values means not reloading local variables from shared memory. For example, a compiler must not discard i and reload it a second time from *p in this program:\n\ni := *p\nif i \u003c 0 || i \u003e= len(funcs) {\n\tpanic(\"invalid function index\")\n}\n... complex code ...\n// compiler must NOT reload i = *p here\nfuncs[i]()\nIf the complex code needs many registers, a compiler for single-threaded programs could discard i without saving a copy and then reload i = *p just before funcs[i](). A Go compiler must not, because the value of *p may have changed. (Instead, the compiler could spill i to the stack.)\n\nNot allowing a single write to write multiple values also means not using the memory where a local variable will be written as temporary storage before the write. For example, a compiler must not use *p as temporary storage in this program:\n\n*p = i + *p/2\nThat is, it must not rewrite the program into this one:\n\n*p /= 2\n*p += i\nIf i and *p start equal to 2, the original code does *p = 3, so a racing thread can read only 2 or 3 from *p. The rewritten code does *p = 1 and then *p = 3, allowing a racing thread to read 1 as well.\n\nNote that all these optimizations are permitted in C/C++ compilers: a Go compiler sharing a back end with a C/C++ compiler must take care to disable optimizations that are invalid for Go.\n\nNote that the prohibition on introducing data races does not apply if the compiler can prove that the races do not affect correct execution on the target platform. For example, on essentially all CPUs, it is valid to rewrite\n\nn := 0\nfor i := 0; i \u003c m; i++ {\n\tn += *shared\n}\ninto:\nn := 0\nlocal := *shared\nfor i := 0; i \u003c m; i++ {\n\tn += local\n}\nprovided it can be proved that *shared will not fault on access, because the potential added read will not affect any existing concurrent reads or writes. On the other hand, the rewrite would not be valid in a source-to-source translator.\n\nConclusion\nGo programmers writing data-race-free programs can rely on sequentially consistent execution of those programs, just as in essentially all other modern programming languages.\n\nWhen it comes to programs with races, both programmers and compilers should remember the advice: don't be clever.\n\nWhy Go\nUse Cases\nCase Studies\nGet Started\nPlayground\nTour\nStack Overflow\nHelp\nPackages\nStandard Library\nAbout Go Packages\nAbout\nDownload\nBlog\nIssue Tracker\nRelease Notes\nBrand Guidelines\nCode of Conduct\nConnect\nTwitter\nGitHub\nSlack\nr/golang\nMeetup\nGolang Weekly\nThe Go Gopher\nCopyright\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nReport an Issue\nSystem theme\nGoogle logo\ngo.dev uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.

However, under typical circumstances and assuming a well-behaved Go runtime and hardware, `tempX` will point to either the value of `X` before or after the update, not to a completely random or uninitialized memory location. The Go memory model and the hardware it runs on ensure basic atomicity for pointer assignments, meaning a pointer value is either fully updated or not updated at all from the perspective of a single CPU core executing these instructions.\n\nIn the context of your example:\n\n```go\ngo func() {\n  for {\n    X = NewMyStruct() // Update pointer X to a new instance\n  }\n}()\n\ngo func() {\n  tempX = X // Copy X to tempX\n  // Print something based on tempX\n}()\n```\n\nThere are a few scenarios regarding `tempX`:\n\n1. **Before the Update**: `tempX` captures the value of `X` before it is updated by the first goroutine.\n2. **After the Update**: `tempX` captures the value of `X` after the update.\n3. **Data Race Undefined Behavior**: In theory, due to the data race, the behavior is undefined within the Go memory model, which might suggest a range of unpredictable outcomes. However, in practice, because of the way modern computers work, `tempX` is highly unlikely to point to a completely arbitrary or invalid memory location due to the atomic nature of pointer assignments on most platforms. A data race might cause your program to see an old or new value, but not a random address.\n\nHowever, \"undefined behavior\" in the context of data races means that the program's behavior is not predictable or guaranteed by the language's memory model. It doesn't necessarily mean that the program will do something entirely nonsensical like assigning a random memory address to `tempX`, but it does mean the program's correctness cannot be assured, and it might behave differently across runs, compiler versions, or hardware.\n\nThe key takeaway is that while you might not get a \"completely random value\" in the sense of pointing to arbitrary memory, accessing shared memory without proper synchronization in concurrent programming can lead to subtle, hard-to-debug errors. It's always best practice to use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, channels, or atomic operations to ensure memory visibility and avoid data races, ensuring that your program behaves correctly and predictably."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"is_complete":true,"model_slug":"gpt-4","parent_id":"aaa27c68-1328-4e57-b7f1-39aecaf8cb84","timestamp_":"absolute","shared_conversation_id":"f8aade6f-7822-484a-9057-f656f7429669"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"aaa27c68-1328-4e57-b7f1-39aecaf8cb84","children":["aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf"]},"aaa27c68-1328-4e57-b7f1-39aecaf8cb84":{"id":"aaa27c68-1328-4e57-b7f1-39aecaf8cb84","message":{"id":"aaa27c68-1328-4e57-b7f1-39aecaf8cb84","author":{"role":"user","metadata":{}},"create_time":1707027579.750923,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Is it possible for tempX to point to something other than a prior instance of X, or can it be a completely random value if the pointer-copy happens at precisely the wrong time?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","weight":1,"metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute","shared_conversation_id":"f8aade6f-7822-484a-9057-f656f7429669"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"5a8ba3af-2708-434f-be91-6c813ae69a60","children":["ebb938ba-661b-47eb-8ff3-7429cd7e1663"]},"5a8ba3af-2708-434f-be91-6c813ae69a60":{"id":"5a8ba3af-2708-434f-be91-6c813ae69a60","message":{"id":"5a8ba3af-2708-434f-be91-6c813ae69a60","author":{"role":"assistant","metadata":{}},"create_time":1707027500.388621,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["In the example you've provided, where one goroutine continuously updates a pointer `X` to point to a new instance of `MyStruct` and another goroutine reads from this pointer, you most likely need to use synchronization mechanisms such as a lock to avoid potential data races and ensure memory visibility between goroutines.\n\nIn Go, the memory model does not guarantee that changes made by one goroutine to shared variables (like your pointer `X`) are immediately visible to other goroutines without proper synchronization.

This section gives a general overview of the approach and should suffice for most programmers. The memory model is specified more formally in the next section.\n\nA data race is defined as a write to a memory location happening concurrently with another read or write to that same location, unless all the accesses involved are atomic data accesses as provided by the sync/atomic package. As noted already, programmers are strongly encouraged to use appropriate synchronization to avoid data races. In the absence of data races, Go programs behave as if all the goroutines were multiplexed onto a single processor. This property is sometimes referred to as DRF-SC: data-race-free programs execute in a sequentially consistent manner.\n\nWhile programmers should write Go programs without data races, there are limitations to what a Go implementation can do in response to a data race. An implementation may always react to a data race by reporting the race and terminating the program. Otherwise, each read of a single-word-sized or sub-word-sized memory location must observe a value actually written to that location (perhaps by a concurrent executing goroutine) and not yet overwritten. These implementation constraints make Go more like Java or JavaScript, in that most races have a limited number of outcomes, and less like C and C++, where the meaning of any program with a race is entirely undefined, and the compiler may do anything at all. Go's approach aims to make errant programs more reliable and easier to debug, while still insisting that races are errors and that tools can diagnose and report them.\n\nMemory Model\nThe following formal definition of Go's memory model closely follows the approach presented by Hans-J. Boehm and Sarita V. Adve in “Foundations of the C++ Concurrency Memory Model”, published in PLDI 2008. The definition of data-race-free programs and the guarantee of sequential consistency for race-free programs are equivalent to the ones in that work.\n\nThe memory model describes the requirements on program executions, which are made up of goroutine executions, which in turn are made up of memory operations.\n\nA memory operation is modeled by four details:\n\nits kind, indicating whether it is an ordinary data read, an ordinary data write, or a synchronizing operation such as an atomic data access, a mutex operation, or a channel operation,\nits location in the program,\nthe memory location or variable being accessed, and\nthe values read or written by the operation.\nSome memory operations are read-like, including read, atomic read, mutex lock, and channel receive. Other memory operations are write-like, including write, atomic write, mutex unlock, channel send, and channel close. Some, such as atomic compare-and-swap, are both read-like and write-like.\n\nA goroutine execution is modeled as a set of memory operations executed by a single goroutine.\n\nRequirement 1: The memory operations in each goroutine must correspond to a correct sequential execution of that goroutine, given the values read from and written to memory. That execution must be consistent with the sequenced before relation, defined as the partial order requirements set out by the Go language specification for Go's control flow constructs as well as the order of evaluation for expressions.\n\nA Go program execution is modeled as a set of goroutine executions, together with a mapping W that specifies the write-like operation that each read-like operation reads from. (Multiple executions of the same program can have different program executions.)\n\nRequirement 2: For a given program execution, the mapping W, when limited to synchronizing operations, must be explainable by some implicit total order of the synchronizing operations that is consistent with sequencing and the values read and written by those operations.\n\nThe synchronized before relation is a partial order on synchronizing memory operations, derived from W. If a synchronizing read-like memory operation r observes a synchronizing write-like memory operation w (that is, if W(r) = w), then w is synchronized before r. Informally, the synchronized before relation is a subset of the implied total order mentioned in the previous paragraph, limited to the information that W directly observes.\n\nThe happens before relation is defined as the transitive closure of the union of the sequenced before and synchronized before relations.\n\nRequirement 3: For an ordinary (non-synchronizing) data read r on a memory location x, W(r) must be a write w that is visible to r, where visible means that both of the following hold:\n\nw happens before r.\nw does not happen before any other write w' (to x) that happens before r.\nA read-write data race on memory location x consists of a read-like memory operation r on x and a write-like memory operation w on x, at least one of which is non-synchronizing, which are unordered by happens before (that is, neither r happens before w nor w happens before r).\n\nA write-write data race on memory location x consists of two write-like memory operations w and w' on x, at least one of which is non-synchronizing, which are unordered by happens before.\n\nNote that if there are no read-write or write-write data races on memory location x, then any read r on x has only one possible W(r): the single w that immediately precedes it in the happens before order.\n\nMore generally, it can be shown that any Go program that is data-race-free, meaning it has no program executions with read-write or write-write data races, can only have outcomes explained by some sequentially consistent interleaving of the goroutine executions. (The proof is the same as Section 7 of Boehm and Adve's paper cited above.) This property is called DRF-SC.\n\nThe intent of the formal definition is to match the DRF-SC guarantee provided to race-free programs by other languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Swift.\n\nCertain Go language operations such as goroutine creation and memory allocation act as synchronization operations. The effect of these operations on the synchronized-before partial order is documented in the “Synchronization” section below. Individual packages are responsible for providing similar documentation for their own operations.\n\nImplementation Restrictions for Programs Containing Data Races\nThe preceding section gave a formal definition of data-race-free program execution. This section informally describes the semantics that implementations must provide for programs that do contain races.\n\nFirst, any implementation can, upon detecting a data race, report the race and halt execution of the program. Implementations using ThreadSanitizer (accessed with “go build -race”) do exactly this.\n\nOtherwise, a read r of a memory location x that is not larger than a machine word must observe some write w such that r does not happen before w and there is no write w' such that w happens before w' and w' happens before r. That is, each read must observe a value written by a preceding or concurrent write.\n\nAdditionally, observation of acausal and “out of thin air” writes is disallowed.\n\nReads of memory locations larger than a single machine word are encouraged but not required to meet the same semantics as word-sized memory locations, observing a single allowed write w. For performance reasons, implementations may instead treat larger operations as a set of individual machine-word-sized operations in an unspecified order. This means that races on multiword data structures can lead to inconsistent values not corresponding to a single write. When the values depend on the consistency of internal (pointer, length) or (pointer, type) pairs, as can be the case for interface values, maps, slices, and strings in most Go implementations, such races can in turn lead to arbitrary memory corruption.\n\nExamples of incorrect synchronization are given in the “Incorrect synchronization” section below.\n\nExamples of the limitations on implementations are given in the “Incorrect compilation” section below.\n\nSynchronization\nInitialization\nProgram initialization runs in a single goroutine, but that goroutine may create other goroutines, which run concurrently.\n\nIf a package p imports package q, the completion of q's init functions happens before the start of any of p's.\n\nThe completion of all init functions is synchronized before the start of the function main.main.\n\nGoroutine creation\nThe go statement that starts a new goroutine is synchronized before the start of the goroutine's execution.\n\nFor example, in this program:\n\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc hello() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tgo f()\n}\ncalling hello will print \"hello, world\" at some point in the future (perhaps after hello has returned).\n\nGoroutine destruction\nThe exit of a goroutine is not guaranteed to be synchronized before any event in the program. For example, in this program:\n\nvar a string\n\nfunc hello() {\n\tgo func() { a = \"hello\" }()\n\tprint(a)\n}\nthe assignment to a is not followed by any synchronization event, so it is not guaranteed to be observed by any other goroutine. In fact, an aggressive compiler might delete the entire go statement.\n\nIf the effects of a goroutine must be observed by another goroutine, use a synchronization mechanism such as a lock or channel communication to establish a relative ordering.\n\nChannel communication\nChannel communication is the main method of synchronization between goroutines. Each send on a particular channel is matched to a corresponding receive from that channel, usually in a different goroutine.\n\nA send on a channel is synchronized before the completion of the corresponding receive from that channel.\n\nThis program:\n\nvar c = make(chan int, 10)\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tc \u003c- 0\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo f()\n\t\u003c-c\n\tprint(a)\n}\nis guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". The write to a is sequenced before the send on c, which is synchronized before the corresponding receive on c completes, which is sequenced before the print.\n\nThe closing of a channel is synchronized before a receive that returns a zero value because the channel is closed.\n\nIn the previous example, replacing c \u003c- 0 with close(c) yields a program with the same guaranteed behavior.\n\nA receive from an unbuffered channel is synchronized before the completion of the corresponding send on that channel.\n\nThis program (as above, but with the send and receive statements swapped and using an unbuffered channel):\n\nvar c = make(chan int)\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\t\u003c-c\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo f()\n\tc \u003c- 0\n\tprint(a)\n}\nis also guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". The write to a is sequenced before the receive on c, which is synchronized before the corresponding send on c completes, which is sequenced before the print.\n\nIf the channel were buffered (e.g., c = make(chan int, 1)) then the program would not be guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". (It might print the empty string, crash, or do something else.)\n\nThe kth receive on a channel with capacity C is synchronized before the completion of the k+Cth send from that channel completes.\n\nThis rule generalizes the previous rule to buffered channels. It allows a counting semaphore to be modeled by a buffered channel: the number of items in the channel corresponds to the number of active uses, the capacity of the channel corresponds to the maximum number of simultaneous uses, sending an item acquires the semaphore, and receiving an item releases the semaphore. This is a common idiom for limiting concurrency.\n\nThis program starts a goroutine for every entry in the work list, but the goroutines coordinate using the limit channel to ensure that at most three are running work functions at a time.\n\nvar limit = make(chan int, 3)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfor _, w := range work {\n\t\tgo func(w func()) {\n\t\t\tlimit \u003c- 1\n\t\t\tw()\n\t\t\t\u003c-limit\n\t\t}(w)\n\t}\n\tselect{}\n}\nLocks\nThe sync package implements two lock data types, sync.Mutex and sync.RWMutex.\n\nFor any sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex variable l and n \u003c m, call n of l.Unlock() is synchronized before call m of l.Lock() returns.\n\nThis program:\n\nvar l sync.Mutex\nvar a string\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tl.Unlock()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tl.Lock()\n\tgo f()\n\tl.Lock()\n\tprint(a)\n}\nis guaranteed to print \"hello, world\". The first call to l.Unlock() (in f) is synchronized before the second call to l.Lock() (in main) returns, which is sequenced before the print.\n\nFor any call to l.RLock on a sync.RWMutex variable l, there is an n such that the nth call to l.Unlock is synchronized before the return from l.RLock, and the matching call to l.RUnlock is synchronized before the return from call n+1 to l.Lock.\n\nA successful call to l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) is equivalent to a call to l.Lock (or l.RLock). An unsuccessful call has no synchronizing effect at all. As far as the memory model is concerned, l.TryLock (or l.TryRLock) may be considered to be able to return false even when the mutex l is unlocked.\n\nOnce\nThe sync package provides a safe mechanism for initialization in the presence of multiple goroutines through the use of the Once type. Multiple threads can execute once.Do(f) for a particular f, but only one will run f(), and the other calls block until f() has returned.\n\nThe completion of a single call of f() from once.Do(f) is synchronized before the return of any call of once.Do(f).\n\nIn this program:\n\nvar a string\nvar once sync.Once\n\nfunc setup() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n}\n\nfunc doprint() {\n\tonce.Do(setup)\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc twoprint() {\n\tgo doprint()\n\tgo doprint()\n}\ncalling twoprint will call setup exactly once. The setup function will complete before either call of print. The result will be that \"hello, world\" will be printed twice.\n\nAtomic Values\nThe APIs in the sync/atomic package are collectively “atomic operations” that can be used to synchronize the execution of different goroutines. If the effect of an atomic operation A is observed by atomic operation B, then A is synchronized before B. All the atomic operations executed in a program behave as though executed in some sequentially consistent order.\n\nThe preceding definition has the same semantics as C++’s sequentially consistent atomics and Java’s volatile variables.\n\nFinalizers\nThe runtime package provides a SetFinalizer function that adds a finalizer to be called when a particular object is no longer reachable by the program. A call to SetFinalizer(x, f) is synchronized before the finalization call f(x).\n\nAdditional Mechanisms\nThe sync package provides additional synchronization abstractions, including condition variables, lock-free maps, allocation pools, and wait groups. The documentation for each of these specifies the guarantees it makes concerning synchronization.\n\nOther packages that provide synchronization abstractions should document the guarantees they make too.\n\nIncorrect synchronization\nPrograms with races are incorrect and can exhibit non-sequentially consistent executions. In particular, note that a read r may observe the value written by any write w that executes concurrently with r. Even if this occurs, it does not imply that reads happening after r will observe writes that happened before w.\n\nIn this program:\n\nvar a, b int\n\nfunc f() {\n\ta = 1\n\tb = 2\n}\n\nfunc g() {\n\tprint(b)\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo f()\n\tg()\n}\nit can happen that g prints 2 and then 0.\n\nThis fact invalidates a few common idioms.\n\nDouble-checked locking is an attempt to avoid the overhead of synchronization. For example, the twoprint program might be incorrectly written as:\n\nvar a string\nvar done bool\n\nfunc setup() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tdone = true\n}\n\nfunc doprint() {\n\tif !done {\n\t\tonce.Do(setup)\n\t}\n\tprint(a)\n}\n\nfunc twoprint() {\n\tgo doprint()\n\tgo doprint()\n}\nbut there is no guarantee that, in doprint, observing the write to done implies observing the write to a. This version can (incorrectly) print an empty string instead of \"hello, world\".\n\nAnother incorrect idiom is busy waiting for a value, as in:\n\nvar a string\nvar done bool\n\nfunc setup() {\n\ta = \"hello, world\"\n\tdone = true\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo setup()\n\tfor !done {\n\t}\n\tprint(a)\n}\nAs before, there is no guarantee that, in main, observing the write to done implies observing the write to a, so this program could print an empty string too. Worse, there is no guarantee that the write to done will ever be observed by main, since there are no synchronization events between the two threads. The loop in main is not guaranteed to finish.\n\nThere are subtler variants on this theme, such as this program.\n\ntype T struct {\n\tmsg string\n}\n\nvar g *T\n\nfunc setup() {\n\tt := new(T)\n\tt.msg = \"hello, world\"\n\tg = t\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tgo setup()\n\tfor g == nil {\n\t}\n\tprint(g.msg)\n}\nEven if main observes g != nil and exits its loop, there is no guarantee that it will observe the initialized value for g.msg.\n\nIn all these examples, the solution is the same: use explicit synchronization.\n\nIncorrect compilation\nThe Go memory model restricts compiler optimizations as much as it does Go programs. Some compiler optimizations that would be valid in single-threaded programs are not valid in all Go programs. In particular, a compiler must not introduce writes that do not exist in the original program, it must not allow a single read to observe multiple values, and it must not allow a single write to write multiple values.\n\nAll the following examples assume that `*p` and `*q` refer to memory locations accessible to multiple goroutines.\n\nNot introducing data races into race-free programs means not moving writes out of conditional statements in which they appear. For example, a compiler must not invert the conditional in this program:\n\n*p = 1\nif cond {\n\t*p = 2\n}\nThat is, the compiler must not rewrite the program into this one:\n\n*p = 2\nif !cond {\n\t*p = 1\n}\nIf cond is false and another goroutine is reading *p, then in the original program, the other goroutine can only observe any prior value of *p and 1. In the rewritten program, the other goroutine can observe 2, which was previously impossible.\n\nNot introducing data races also means not assuming that loops terminate. For example, a compiler must in general not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the loop in this program:\n\nn := 0\nfor e := list; e != nil; e = e.next {\n\tn++\n}\ni := *p\n*q = 1\nIf list pointed to a cyclic list, then the original program would never access *p or *q, but the rewritten program would. (Moving `*p` ahead would be safe if the compiler can prove `*p` will not panic; moving `*q` ahead would also require the compiler proving that no other goroutine can access `*q`.)\n\nNot introducing data races also means not assuming that called functions always return or are free of synchronization operations. For example, a compiler must not move the accesses to *p or *q ahead of the function call in this program (at least not without direct knowledge of the precise behavior of f):\n\nf()\ni := *p\n*q = 1\nIf the call never returned, then once again the original program would never access *p or *q, but the rewritten program would. And if the call contained synchronizing operations, then the original program could establish happens before edges preceding the accesses to *p and *q, but the rewritten program would not.\n\nNot allowing a single read to observe multiple values means not reloading local variables from shared memory. For example, a compiler must not discard i and reload it a second time from *p in this program:\n\ni := *p\nif i \u003c 0 || i \u003e= len(funcs) {\n\tpanic(\"invalid function index\")\n}\n... complex code ...\n// compiler must NOT reload i = *p here\nfuncs[i]()\nIf the complex code needs many registers, a compiler for single-threaded programs could discard i without saving a copy and then reload i = *p just before funcs[i](). A Go compiler must not, because the value of *p may have changed. (Instead, the compiler could spill i to the stack.)\n\nNot allowing a single write to write multiple values also means not using the memory where a local variable will be written as temporary storage before the write. For example, a compiler must not use *p as temporary storage in this program:\n\n*p = i + *p/2\nThat is, it must not rewrite the program into this one:\n\n*p /= 2\n*p += i\nIf i and *p start equal to 2, the original code does *p = 3, so a racing thread can read only 2 or 3 from *p. The rewritten code does *p = 1 and then *p = 3, allowing a racing thread to read 1 as well.\n\nNote that all these optimizations are permitted in C/C++ compilers: a Go compiler sharing a back end with a C/C++ compiler must take care to disable optimizations that are invalid for Go.\n\nNote that the prohibition on introducing data races does not apply if the compiler can prove that the races do not affect correct execution on the target platform. For example, on essentially all CPUs, it is valid to rewrite\n\nn := 0\nfor i := 0; i \u003c m; i++ {\n\tn += *shared\n}\ninto:\nn := 0\nlocal := *shared\nfor i := 0; i \u003c m; i++ {\n\tn += local\n}\nprovided it can be proved that *shared will not fault on access, because the potential added read will not affect any existing concurrent reads or writes. On the other hand, the rewrite would not be valid in a source-to-source translator.\n\nConclusion\nGo programmers writing data-race-free programs can rely on sequentially consistent execution of those programs, just as in essentially all other modern programming languages.\n\nWhen it comes to programs with races, both programmers and compilers should remember the advice: don't be clever.\n\nWhy Go\nUse Cases\nCase Studies\nGet Started\nPlayground\nTour\nStack Overflow\nHelp\nPackages\nStandard Library\nAbout Go Packages\nAbout\nDownload\nBlog\nIssue Tracker\nRelease Notes\nBrand Guidelines\nCode of Conduct\nConnect\nTwitter\nGitHub\nSlack\nr/golang\nMeetup\nGolang Weekly\nThe Go Gopher\nCopyright\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nReport an Issue\nSystem theme\nGoogle logo\ngo.dev uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.

Here are the key points relevant to your question about copying a pointer:\n\n1. **Synchronization Requirements**: The document emphasizes that programs modifying data accessed concurrently by multiple goroutines must serialize such access to ensure that all goroutines see a consistent view of the data. This serialization can be achieved through channel operations or synchronization primitives provided by the `sync` and `sync/atomic` packages.\n\n2. **Atomic Operations**: For pointer copying specifically, the memory model doesn't detail this scenario explicitly. However, it mentions that atomic operations provided by the `sync/atomic` package ensure visibility of changes across goroutines. While copying a pointer is typically considered an atomic operation on most hardware (meaning the operation completes in a single step without interruption), the Go Memory Model advises using explicit synchronization to guarantee that all goroutines have a consistent view of the memory.\n\n3. **Data Races and Undefined Behavior**: The document defines a data race as concurrent access to the same variable by multiple goroutines, where at least one access is a write, and there's no ordering of these accesses through synchronization. Accessing a variable in such a way without proper synchronization is considered a data race, leading to undefined behavior. This means that while copying a pointer is generally safe (because the action of copying the pointer itself is atomic), accessing the pointed-to data without synchronization can cause data races if one goroutine writes to the data while another reads or writes it.\n\n4. **Advice on Synchronization**: The most direct advice the document offers is to avoid being \"too clever\" by trying to bypass the synchronization mechanisms provided by Go. It suggests that if your program's correctness relies on understanding the subtle details of the memory model, you're likely not using synchronization primitives correctly.\n\nIn summary, while copying a pointer itself might not require synchronization due to the atomic nature of pointer assignment on most platforms, accessing the data pointed to by that pointer across multiple goroutines without proper synchronization can lead to data races. Therefore, the safe approach for concurrent programming in Go is to use channels, mutexes, or atomic operations from the `sync` and `sync/atomic` packages to serialize access to shared data, including when working with pointers shared across goroutines."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"is_complete":true,"model_slug":"gpt-4","parent_id":"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf","timestamp_":"absolute","shared_conversation_id":"f8aade6f-7822-484a-9057-f656f7429669"},"recipient":"all"},"parent":"aaa20916-3615-4437-a756-7c3c3c8a8bcf","children":[]}],"has_user_editable_context":false,"continue_conversation_url":"https://chat.openai.com/share/f8aade6f-7822-484a-9057-f656f7429669/continue","model":{"slug":"gpt-4","max_tokens":32767,"title":"Retrieval
