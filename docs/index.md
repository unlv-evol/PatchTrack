# PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT’s Influence on Pull Request Outcomes

### Abstract (Short)
The rapid adoption of **large language models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT has introduced new dynamics in software development, particularly within pull request workflows. While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze **338 pull requests** from **255** GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including **645** AI-generated snippets and **3,486** developer-authored patches. We introduce `PatchTrack`, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was **25%**. A qualitative analysis of **89** pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of *structural integration*, *selective extraction*, and *iterative refinement*, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT’s output as a starting point rather than a final implementation.
