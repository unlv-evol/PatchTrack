# PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT’s Influence on Pull Request Outcomes

### Abstract (Short)
The use of **large language models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT in software development has surged, yet their role in collaborative workflows, particularly in patch decision-making within pull requests (PRs), remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by analyzing developers' ChatGPT interactions across **285 merged PRs**, capturing 645 ChatGPT-generated code snippets and 3,486 patches from these PRs, systematically comparing them to assess integration patterns. Using this data, we developed `PatchTrack`, a classification tool that determines whether ChatGPT-generated patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, identifying 115 applied patches, 64 not applied, and 106 cases with no patch suggestions. Additionally, we examine 53 closed PRs to assess how ChatGPT influences PR rejection. `PatchTrack` achieves **97.5% accuracy**, **96.5% precision**, **96.7% recall**, and a **96.6% F1-score**.

## Setting up 
To setup and test `PatchTrack` tool on your local computer, following the steps below:
### Get the code
The easiest way is using the `git clone` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/replication-pack/PatchTrack.git
```
### Minimum System Requirements
- `Operating System`: Mac0SX, Linux, Windows
- `RAM`: >= 4 GB
- `Storage`: >= 1 GB
- `Processor`: CPU 1.18 GHz or greater
#### Other tools
- Git, Python >= 3.10
### Python Virtual Environment
Let's set python virtual environment;

```bash
cd PatchTrack/

python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment 

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Dependencies and Dataset

`PatchTrack` consist of two categories of depencies i.e. (i) OS specific dependencies and (ii) development dependencies. The OS specific dependency is `libmagic`. To dependencis will be installed automatically when you start the tool.  

Datasets are stored in the `dataprep` directory in zipped files. This will be automatically extracted and placed in the right directory using the step below. Now, let us install the dependencies and load the required datasets.

```bash
python PatchTrack.py --init
```
The above command will install all the required packages, set directories and unzip datasets for the smooth execution of the tool.
Note: `PatchTrack` has been tested on `python >= 3.10`

You can also install the OS-specific libraries manually on `Ubuntu/Debian` or `MacOS X`, by runing the shell script in the `bin` directory.

```bash
cd bin/
chmod +x os-package.sh
./os-package.sh
```
The above code will automatically detect the OS (Linux or MacOS X) and install the libraries. Note: This is required before installing development specific dependencies.

## Running the tool
### Notebook - Reproducing the results
This is the easiest approach to test the tool and **reproduce the classification results presented in the paper**. In the `notebooks` directory, simply run the `run_experiment.ipynb` file. 
### Console
If you wish to play with `PatchTrack`, there are a number of command line arguments for configuring different part of the tool. Some of those option are actively being improved. We are developing a comprehensive documentation of the tool which will be uploaded soon.
### List of Commands
Information of the other command line options are provided by using `-h` or `--help`
```
usage: PatchTrack.py [-h] [-i] [-n NUM] [-c NUM] [-v] [-p STR] [-s SOURCE_PATH] [-r]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --init            setup required datasets and directories. This command should be executed at least once
  -n NUM, --ngram NUM   use n-gram of NUM lines (default: 1)
  -c NUM, --context NUM
                        print NUM lines of context (default: 10)
  -v, --verbose         enable verbose mode (default: False)
  -p STR, --patch_path STR
                        path to ChatGPT and PR patch files (default: data/patches)
  -s SOURCE_PATH, --source_path SOURCE_PATH
                        path to json files of extracted ChatGPT conversations and code snippets (default: data/extracted)
  -r, --restore         restore default setting, files and directories
```
### GitHub Tokens
We use [GitHub tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) when extracting PR patches. This allows for higher rate limit because of the high number of requests to the GitHub API. Tokens can be set in the `tokens.txt` file seperated by a comman. The user can add as many tokens as needed. A minimal of 2 tokens can be used to safely execute code and to make sure that the rate limit is not reached for a token.
